# Active contour skin lesion segmentation

A combination of numeric and machine learning algorithms for skin lesion segmentation
and training data generation. A modified VGG16 neural network predicts an initial contour (elipse parameters) 
for the active contours numeric algorithm. The application can be use to generate training data for other machine learning models.

The projects use: VGG16, Tensorflow, OpenCV, numpy and Skimage

Slug size: 495 Mb

Suitable for Heroku deployment with Tensorflow-CPU library.
